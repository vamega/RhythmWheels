    This is a simple example of a story - to help you

        Look at the <em>code</em> section of this page within the
        <em>Script Editor</em> to see how to
        display a button to the user, and how to write code that runs
        when the button is Clicked. You write text within the body of
        the page to describe the purpose of the button, for example: <br/>
        Press the <em>Make Square</em> button below to make a square.
